# python-challenge
PyPoll I feel like could be simplified but I couldn't figure out how to do it. 
revenue_change and monthly_change feel redundant by I couldn't figure out how to get the greatest increase and decrease without using a variable.
Just figuring out the correct equation to get average change was a struggle I had to do some googling to figure that out.

PyBank by contrast was a lot easier. However, you can see I submitted it before fully proof-reading. 
I submitted first with a typo, and then again when I realized I had set a variable to be a string instead of an integer.
It didn't matter since I cast it in the correct locations but I corrected it because it was bothering me.
